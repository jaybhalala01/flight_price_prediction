# Flight Price Prediction Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Flight Price Prediction project! This project aims to predict flight prices based on various features, enabling travelers to make informed decisions when booking their flights. In this README file, we'll provide an overview of the project, the data used, exploratory data analysis (EDA), domain knowledge, model training, and model stacking.

## 1. Project Overview <a name="project-overview"></a>

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict flight prices accurately. Predicting flight prices can be challenging due to various factors such as airline, departure location, arrival location, time of booking, and more. By analyzing historical flight data and applying machine learning techniques, we aim to provide travelers with price estimates that can help them plan their trips more effectively.

## 2. Data <a name="data"></a>

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains historical flight data, including various features such as departure location, arrival location, airline, departure time, and more. It is important to preprocess and clean the data before using it for model training.

### Data Source

The data was collected from reputable sources, and it represents a diverse range of flights from different airlines, routes, and times.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) <a name="eda"></a>

EDA is a crucial step in understanding the dataset and identifying patterns, trends, and outliers. It involves statistical and visual analysis to gain insights into the data. Key EDA steps for this project include:

- Summary statistics of key features.
- Data visualization (histograms, scatter plots, etc.) to visualize relationships between features.
- Identifying and handling missing data.
- Detecting outliers and deciding whether to remove or transform them.
- Feature engineering, if necessary, to create new meaningful features.

## 4. Domain Knowledge <a name="domain-knowledge"></a>

Understanding the domain is essential for building an effective flight price prediction model. It involves gaining knowledge about the factors that influence flight prices, such as:

- Seasonal variations.
- Airline pricing strategies.
- Peak travel times.
- Impact of events and holidays on prices.
- Route popularity and competition.

Domain knowledge will guide feature selection and engineering and help in creating a model that reflects real-world pricing dynamics.

## 5. Model Training <a name="model-training"></a>

In this phase, we will develop and train machine learning models to predict flight prices. Various algorithms, such as linear regression, random forests, gradient boosting, and neural networks, may be explored to find the best-performing model. The following steps will be taken:

- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Feature scaling and encoding categorical variables.
- Model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
- Training and evaluation of models.
- Selection of the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).

## 6. Model Stacking <a name="model-stacking"></a>

Model stacking is an advanced technique that combines the predictions of multiple models to improve predictive accuracy. In this project, we will explore model stacking by:

- Creating an ensemble of diverse machine learning models.
- Combining their predictions to make the final flight price predictions.
- Evaluating the ensemble model's performance against individual models.

By implementing model stacking, we aim to harness the strengths of various models to provide more accurate flight price predictions.
