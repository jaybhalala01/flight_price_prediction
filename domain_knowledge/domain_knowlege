This can help manufacturers optimize their HVAC systems and reduce energy consumption.

+Material Quality Control: Develop models to identify material quality issues in the manufacturing process based on data from material suppliers, inspection data, and other factors. This can help manufacturers ensure that they are using high-quality materials and reduce waste.

- Price prediction of new products for manufacturers from existing products in market
In the manufacturing domain, price prediction models can be a powerful tool for helping manufacturers to make informed decisions about the pricing of their new products. By analyzing historical data on existing products in the market, manufacturers can gain insights into the pricing strategies of their competitors, identify pricing trends in the market, and develop pricing models that maximize profitability.

In addition to improving pricing decisions, price prediction models can also be used to optimize other aspects of the manufacturing process. For example, they can be used to predict the cost of raw materials or the cost of manufacturing a new product, which can help manufacturers to make better decisions about production volume and inventory management.

Manufacturers can also use price prediction models to improve their supply chain management. By predicting the price of raw materials and other inputs, manufacturers can identify opportunities to reduce costs and optimize their procurement processes.

Overall, price prediction models are a valuable tool for manufacturers in the highly competitive manufacturing industry. By using data-driven insights to optimize pricing, manufacturers can gain a competitive advantage, increase profitability, and improve their overall performance.
